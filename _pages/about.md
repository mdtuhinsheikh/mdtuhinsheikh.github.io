I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in [Statistics](https://stat.uconn.edu/) [Fall 2017 - Present] at the University of Connecticut (UConn), Storrs, CT, USA. I am working under the advisory of [Dr. Ming-Hui Chen](http://merlot.stat.uconn.edu/~mhchen/), Board of Trustees Distinguished Professor and Head, Department of Statistics, UConn. 
<!---
My research works broadly focus on competing risks survival data analysis, longitudinal data analysis, joint modelling of longitudinal and survival data, cure rate model, Bayesian computation, and model assessment. I intend to develop statistical methodology to model prostate cancer data. I am also interested in the applications of deep neural network modelling to survival data.

* I will conduct a workshop on "Introduction to R" at the [UConn Sports Analytics Symposium 2021](https://statds.org/events/ucsas2021/workshops.html) on Oct 9, 2021.
* Our recent research works focus on the theoretical innovation of Bayesian joint model for longitudinal and competing risks survival data. 
* I am working on the "EnergyStats" project, where we have been developing an [RShiny dashboard](http://energystats.fo.uconn.edu:9999/) with the real time energy and utility data at UConn. [Note: the link works under the UConn VPN at this moment.]
