Hello! Welcome to my webpage. I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in [Statistics](https://stat.uconn.edu/) [Fall 2017 - Present] at the University of Connecticut (UConn), Storrs, CT, USA. I am working under the advisory of [Dr. Ming-Hui Chen](http://merlot.stat.uconn.edu/~mhchen/), Professor of Statistics, UConn. I have completed my Bachelor and Master Degrees in Applied Statistics at the University of Dhaka in 2013 and 2014, respectively.

My research works broadly focus on competing risks survival data analysis, longitudinal data analysis, joint modelling of longitudinal and survival data, cure rate model, Bayesian computation, and model assessment. I intend to develop statistical methodology to model prostate cancer data. I am also interested in the applications of deep neural network modelling to survival data. 


## Recent Developments
* I am working with a large cancer clinical trials data that has complicated association between longitudinal biomarker and time-to-event. Our recent research works focus on the theoretical innovation of Bayesian joint model for longitudinal and survival data in presence of competing risks. 
* I am working on the "EnergyStat" project, which is a joint collaboration between Utility Operations and Energy Management and the Department of Statistics. We have been developing an RShiny dashboard with the real time energy and utility data at UConn. The project website [link](http://energystats.fo.uconn.edu:9999/). [Note: the link works under the UConn VPN at this moment.]
* In Summer 2020, I worked as a Biostatistics and Data Science intern at Boehringer-Ingelheim. I worked with my manager Dr. Miaomiao Ge and developed an optimized decision making algorithm for early phase clinical trials with binary endpoint using Bayesian predictive probability of futility.
