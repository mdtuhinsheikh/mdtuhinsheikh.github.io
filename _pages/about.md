I am a Ph.D. Candidate in [Statistics](https://stat.uconn.edu/) [Fall 2017 - Present] at the University of Connecticut (UConn), Storrs, CT, USA. I am working under the advisory of [Dr. Ming-Hui Chen](http://merlot.stat.uconn.edu/~mhchen/), Board of Trustees Distinguished Professor and Head, Department of Statistics, UConn. 
<!---
My research works broadly focus on competing risks survival data analysis, longitudinal data analysis, joint modelling of longitudinal and survival data, cure rate model, Bayesian computation, and model assessment. I intend to develop statistical methodology to model prostate cancer data. I am also interested in the applications of deep neural network modelling to survival data.

## Education
- Ph.D. in Statistics, 2017 - 2022 (expected), University of Connecticut, Advisor: [Dr. Ming-Hui Chen](http://merlot.stat.uconn.edu/~mhchen/).
- M.S. in Applied Statistics, 2014, University of Dhaka.
- B.S. in Applied Statistics, 2013, University of Dhaka.

## Research Interests
- Competing risks survival data analysis, longitudinal data analysis, joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data, and cure rate model.
- Bayesian inference, Bayesian computation, model assessment tools, leveraging external data, and interim analysis in clinical trials.
- Microbiome data for premature babies and inflammatory bowel disease, cancer disease, machine learning for survival data, and deep learning.
