I am a Postdoctoral Associate at [Professor Hongyu Zhao's](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/hongyu_zhao/) lab, Department of Biostatistics, Yale University. I earned my Ph.D. in [Statistics](https://stat.uconn.edu/) under the advisory of [Professor Ming-Hui Chen](http://merlot.stat.uconn.edu/~mic02006/) at the University of Connecticut in 2022. 
<!---
My research works broadly focus on competing risks survival data analysis, longitudinal data analysis, joint modelling of longitudinal and survival data, cure rate model, Bayesian computation, and model assessment. I intend to develop statistical methodology to model prostate cancer data. I am also interested in the applications of deep neural network modelling to survival data.
