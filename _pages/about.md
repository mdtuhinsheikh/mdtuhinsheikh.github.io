Hello! Welcome to my webpage. I am a third year Ph.D. student in Statistics [Fall 2017 - Present] 
at the University of Connecticut (UConn), Storrs, CT, USA. I am working under the advisory of 
[Dr. Ming-Hui Chen](http://merlot.stat.uconn.edu/~mhchen/), Professor of Statistics, UConn.

My Research interests include:
* Competing risks survival data analysis
* Longitudinal data analysis
* Joint modellin of longitudinal and survival data
* Bayesian computation
* Model assessment 
* Deep neural network modelling
* Interim analysis in clinical trials

## Recent Developments
* I am working with a large cancer clinical trials data that has complicated association between longitudinal biomarker and time-to-event. Our recent research works focus on the theoretical innovation of Bayesian joint model for longitudinal and survival data in presence of competing risks. 
* I am working on the "EnergyStat" project, which is a joint collaboration between Utility Operations and Energy Management and the Department of Statistics. We have been developing an RShiny dashboard with the real time energy and utility data at UConn. The project website [link](http://energystats.fo.uconn.edu:9999/). [Note: the link works under the UConn VPN at this moment.]
* In Summer 2020, I have been working as a Biostatistics and Data Science intern at Boehringer-Ingelheim. I am working with my manager Dr. Miaomiao Ge on the theoretical development of interim analysis in clinical trials.
