I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in [Statistics](https://stat.uconn.edu/) [Fall 2017 - Present] at the University of Connecticut (UConn), Storrs, CT, USA. I am working under the advisory of [Dr. Ming-Hui Chen](http://merlot.stat.uconn.edu/~mhchen/), Professor of Statistics, UConn. Prior to UConn, I received my Bachelor and Master Degrees in Applied Statistics at the [University of Dhaka](https://www.isrt.ac.bd/people/tsheikh/), Bangladesh.

My research works broadly focus on competing risks survival data analysis, longitudinal data analysis, joint modelling of longitudinal and survival data, cure rate model, Bayesian computation, and model assessment. I intend to develop statistical methodology to model prostate cancer data. I am also interested in the applications of deep neural network modelling to survival data.

## Research Interests
- Competing risks survival data analysis, longitudinal data analysis, joint modelling of longitudinal and survival data, and cure rate model.
- Bayesian statistics, Monte Carlo methodology, model assessment, and co-data analysis.
- Deep neural network modelling, microbiome data analysis, and interim analysis in clinical trials.
- Public health research problems (e.g. Prostate cancer, diabetes, HIV, etc.).

## Recent Developments/News
* I have conducted an R [workshop](https://statds.org/events/ucsas2020/workshops.html) at the [UConn Sports Analytics Symposium 2020](https://statds.org/events/ucsas2020/workshops.html) on Oct 10, 2020.
* I am working with a large cancer clinical trials data that has a complicated association between longitudinal biomarker and time-to-event outcomes. Our recent research works focus on the theoretical innovation of Bayesian joint model for longitudinal and competing risks survival data. 
* I am working on the "EnergyStats" project, which is a joint collaboration between Utility Operations and Energy Management and the Department of Statistics. We have been developing an RShiny dashboard with the real time energy and utility data at UConn. The project website [link](http://energystats.fo.uconn.edu:9999/). [Note: the link works under the UConn VPN at this moment.]
* In Summer 2020, I worked as a Biostatistics and Data Science intern at Boehringer-Ingelheim. I worked with my manager, Dr. Miaomiao Ge and developed an optimized decision making algorithm for early phase clinical trials with binary endpoint using Bayesian predictive probability of futility.
* In 2019, I received "Outstanding Teaching Award (with a scholarship)" at the Department of Statistics, UConn.
