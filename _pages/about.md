I am a Postdoctoral Associate at [Professor Hongyu Zhao's](https://zhaocenter.org/index.html){:target="_blank"} lab, Department of Biostatistics, Yale University since September, 2022. I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics under the advisory of [Professor Ming-Hui Chen](http://merlot.stat.uconn.edu/~mic02006/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Connecticut in 2022. Previously, I received B.S. and M.S. in Applied Statistics at the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh in 2014 and 2015, respectively.

## Research Interests
- Competing risks and semicompeting risks survival data analysis, longitudinal data analysis, joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data, and cure rate model.
- Bayesian inference, Bayesian computation, model assessment tools, leveraging external data, and interim analysis in clinical trials.
- UK Biobank, All of Us, electronic health records, cancer disease, type 2 diabetes, statistical genomics, microbiome data for premature babies and inflammatory bowel disease.
