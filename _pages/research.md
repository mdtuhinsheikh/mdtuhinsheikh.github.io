## Energy-Stats Project 
### UConn, Storrs, CT, Jan 2020 - Present
- This project is a joint collaboration between the Utility Operations & Energy Management and the Department of Statistics at UConn. I have been working as an RA under this project and contributing to the development of an [R Shiny Dashboard Website](\href{https://energystats.fo.uconn.edu/}{https://energystats.fo.uconn.edu/}) (accessible under the UConn domain only at this moment) under the advisory of Prof. Ming-Hui Chen. 

## NIH R01 Grant
### UConn, Storrs, CT, May 2019 - Present
- Joint modeling of longitudinal and competing risks survival data in the presence of missing causes.
- Bayesian C-index under a joint longitudinal and competing risks survival data.
- Leveraging external co-longitudinal and co-survival data.

## Internship Project 
### Boehringer Ingelheim (BI), Ridgefield, CT, May - Aug, 2020
- As a Biostatistics and Data Science Intern, I worked on optimum futility decision making with my mentor Dr. Miaomiao Ge. We proposed a new decision making criterion using the Bayesian predictive probability of failure and developed self-written code.
- Project title: "Optimized Interim Futility Decision Making for Early Phase Clinical Trials with Binary Endpoint using Bayesian Predictive Probability of Failure".
