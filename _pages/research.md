## Energy-Stats Project 
### UConn, Storrs, CT, Jan 2020 - Aug, 2022
- This project is a joint collaboration between the Utility Operations & Energy Management and the Department of Statistics at UConn. I have been working as an Research Assistant under this project and contributing to the development of an [R Shiny Dashboard Website](\href{https://energystats.fo.uconn.edu/}{https://energystats.fo.uconn.edu/}) (accessible under the UConn domain only at this moment) under the advisory of Professor Ming-Hui Chen. 

## NIH R01 Grant
### UConn, Storrs, CT, Jan 2019 - Aug, 2022
- Joint modeling of longitudinal and competing risks survival data in the presence of missing causes.
- Bayesian model assessment to quantify the contribution of longitudinal data to the fit of competing risks survival data.
- Leveraging external co-longitudinal and co-survival data.
- Joint Modeling of Longitudinal and Competing Risk Survival Data in the Presence of Cure Fractions within Machine Learning Framework.

## SON-STAT Project 
### UConn, Storrs, CT, May 2019 - Aug 2019, Jan 2022 - Aug, 2022
- This project is a collaboration between the School of Nursing (SON) and the Department of Statistics (STAT) at UConn. I have been working as an Research Assistant on this project under the mentors: Professor Ming-Hui Chen and Professor Xiaomei Cong. 
- I am working on the gut microbiome data from premature babies to explore their genetic relationship with the demographic and clinical variables.
- I am working on Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) data to investigate the change in microbiome characteristics (e.g. alpha-diversity, beta-diversity) for IBS and healthy control groups. 

## K99/R00 Grant
### UConn, Storrs, CT, Jan 2022 - Aug, 2022
- As an RA, I am working with Dr. Mallory Perry, University of Pennsylvenia, on her K99/R00 project. Our focus is to determiine the risk of physical dysfunction in 
	critically ill children who survive severe sepsis.

## Internship Project 
### Boehringer Ingelheim (BI), Ridgefield, CT, May - Aug, 2020
- I worked on a project to develop a new decision making criterion using the Bayesian predictive probability of failure and developed self-written code. 
- Project title: "Optimized Interim Futility Decision Making for Early Phase Clinical Trials with Binary Endpoint using Bayesian Predictive Probability of Failure", mentor: Dr. Miaomiao Ge.

## NIH R01 Grant Proposal Assisted
### *SON-STAT, UConn, Storrs, CT*, Jan - May, 2020
- Assisted on an R01 grant proposal by working on the sample size calculation and data visualization for a gut microbiome data under the mentors: Prof. Ming-Hui Chen and Prof. Wanli Xu.
### *UNCH-UConn, Storrs, CT*, Jan - May, Sep - Oct, 2020
- I assisted on preparing an R01 grant proposal by contributing on formulating a specific aim, developing statistical methodology, and analyzing preliminary data.
