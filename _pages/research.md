# Areas of expertise
My research aims to dedicated to improving health outcomes through developing advanced statistical methods motivated by datasets such as the UK Biobank, AllofUs, and various cancer studies. 
I am particularly interested in areas like competing and semicompeting risks survival analysis, longitudinal analysis, Bayesian inference, model assessment tools, and statistical genomics. 
Here are a few recent highlights from my work.

**Semicompeting risks model:** In the context of complex diseases, individuals may encounter multiple nonterminal events alongside a single terminal event. 
The occurrence of a terminal event can censor the nonterminal events, but the reverse is not the case. 
Motivated by type 2 diabetes, we propose a semicompeting risks model within the Bayesian framework accounting for two nonterminal events and one terminal event.

**Longitudinal data analysis:** Longitudinal collection of biomarkers play a significant role in disease diagnostics, screening and monitoring, and also classifying subjects with similar behaviors. 
In the presence of time-varying covariates, statistical inference on the effects of these covariates becomes challenging depending their nature (e.g., endogeneity). We are developing  
statistical methodology to classify subjects showing similar behavior accounting for complex nature of multiple time-varying covariates.

**Joint model with competing risks:** In medical studies, longitudinal biomarker and competing risks survival data are collected simultaneously along with other covariates. 
It is common to encounter competering risks survival data with partially masked causes. To examine the association between longitudinal biomarker and competing risks survival data, 
we propose a joint model for longitudinal and competing risks survival data accounting for the masked causes within the Bayesian framework.

**Cure rate model:** In clinical studies, some subjects may never experience the disease of interest (or become cured of it), regardless of the duration of follow-up. 
In the context of competing risks survival data with masked causes, we have developed a mixture cure rate model. 
Our approach integrates a Bayesian joint model, incorporating a mixed-effects model for longitudinal data and a promotion time cure rate model for 
competing risks survival data with masked causes.

**Model assessment tools:** Quantifying the fit of survival data with respect to each cause becomes quite difficult in the presence of masked causes. Within the joint modeling framework, 
we propose cause-specific concordance (C)-index and cause-specific deviance information criterion (DIC). These model assessment tools can be useful to quantify predictive performance 
as well as fit of survival data for each observed cause. Our model assessment tools have also extended within the cure rate models.

**Interim analysis in clinical trials:** Early decision making at phase Ib/II is crucial in the drug development
process. Futility boundary is often desirable to make an appropriate decision at each interim look. During my internship, 
I have developed an optimized interim futility decision making algorithm for early phase clinical trials with binary endpoint using Bayesian 
predictive probability of failure.
