## Energy-Stats Project 
### UConn, Storrs, CT, Jan 2020 - Present
- This project is a joint collaboration between the Utility Operations & Energy Management and the Department of Statistics at UConn. I have been working as an Research Assistant under this project and contributing to the development of an [R Shiny Dashboard Website](\href{https://energystats.fo.uconn.edu/}{https://energystats.fo.uconn.edu/}) (accessible under the UConn domain only at this moment) under the advisory of Professor Ming-Hui Chen. 

## NIH R01 Grant
### UConn, Storrs, CT, Jan 2019 - Present
- Joint modeling of longitudinal and competing risks survival data in the presence of missing causes.
- Bayesian C-index under a joint longitudinal and competing risks survival data.
- Leveraging external co-longitudinal and co-survival data.

## SON-STAT Project 
### UConn, Storrs, CT, May 2019 - Aug 2019, Jan 2022 - Present
- This project is a joint collaboration between between School of Nursing (SON) and Department of Statistics (STAT) at UConn. I have been working as an Research Assistant on this project under the mentors: Professor Ming-Hui Chen and Professor Xiaomei Cong. 
- I worked on the gut microbiome data from premature babies and explored their genetic relationship with the demographic and clinical variables.
- I am working on Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) data to investigate the change in microbiome characteristics (e.g. alpha-diversity, beta-diversity) for IBS and healthy control groups. 

## K99/R00 Grant
### UConn, Storrs, CT, May 2019 - Aug 2019, Jan 2022 - Present
- I am working on critically ill children data who survived sever sepsis with mentor, Dr. Mallory Perry. 

## Internship Project 
### Boehringer Ingelheim (BI), Ridgefield, CT, May - Aug, 2020
- As a Biostatistics and Data Science Intern, I worked on a project to develop a new decision making criterion using the Bayesian predictive probability of failure and developed self-written code. 
- Project title: "Optimized Interim Futility Decision Making for Early Phase Clinical Trials with Binary Endpoint using Bayesian Predictive Probability of Failure", mentor: Dr. Miaomiao Ge.
