"joint model", "logistic regression", "interval censored data model", 
"competing risks model", etc.
* Experience in dealing with "missing data", using "random survival forest", 
"deep neural network" [[Coursera Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/8MC65T7SH99P)], "expectation maximization algorithm", 
designing and performing "simulation study", etc. 

## Statistical software/language
